# PokéDB roadmap

The plan agreed with the user (2026-09-25/26). Work top to bottom; update this file as
steps land (mark them done, note anything decided along the way).

## Order

1. **Lock the Pokémon list** — done (the list below).
2. **Move type audit + neutral elites/bosses** — done (`88fad54`): enemy moves carry their
   real `type`, elites and bosses ignore the type chart both ways.
   - Also done early (`085f4bb`): the StS card revamp (every card rebuilt on a Slay the Spire 1
     card, Weak/Vulnerable, StS-shaped starting decks) and an enemy retune to match. That retune
     only moved the per-biome numbers (`dmgBonus`, `bossBonus`, `hpMult`), so step 5 redoes it
     cheaply once the new roster exists.
3. **New elites and bosses** — done: every biome has its own 3 elites and 3 bosses from the
   list below (one boss picked per run), all with rough numbers in line with what they replaced.
   - Arcanine moved from elite base to a biome-1 boss (150 HP), so `RUN_SAVE_VERSION` went 5 → 6.
   - Salamence stays as a 4th biome-3 boss (bosses are neutral, so it costs nothing).
   - Slaking's pattern is Truant: every other move is a loaf (a block move called Truant).
   - Elites and bosses now also *show* as Neutral (battle nameplate chip, map scouting badge);
     their own types are theme only and stay in the data for the Pokédex.
   - Cries come from PokeAPI (`github.com/PokeAPI/cries`, `cries/pokemon/latest/<dex no>.ogg`),
     since play.pokemonshowdown.com is blocked in cloud sessions: convert to mono 64 kbps MP3
     normalized to about -14 dB mean volume (the level of the existing cries); `pip install
     imageio-ffmpeg` gives an ffmpeg binary, and PIL's median frame bounds match sprite-fit.js.
4. **New wild Pokémon** — done: every biome has its 12 wilds from the list below (3 per type),
   with rough numbers in the range of the wilds they replaced (biome 1 ~40–48 HP, biome 2
   ~48–60, biome 3 ~60–72; the usual attack / setup / big attack shape).
   - Growlithe moved to biome 1 (HP 58 → 46), Magmar became a biome-3 wild (64 HP).
   - Pidgey, Zubat, Machop, Geodude, Rhyhorn, Ponyta and Lapras left the game (sprites, cries,
     sprite-fit entries and defs removed), so `RUN_SAVE_VERSION` went 6 → 7.
   - Team Rocket's teams are now Rattata/Zigzagoon, Houndour/Aipom, Sharpedo/Zangoose: wilds of
     that biome, so the Alpha is lighter than a real elite (no more 700+ HP Rhyhorn).
   - With 12 wilds a biome, a run rarely meets the same wild twice; nothing weights the picks yet
     (the Pokédex step may favour unregistered ones).
5. **Big balance pass** (1 session): the bot harness at Levels 0, 3 and 5 over the new roster,
   retune each biome's numbers, check no type trails; then the user's own playtest (nothing
   has been checked against a real player yet, only the bots).
6. **Pokédex, then catching** (2–3 sessions).

Anytime, as a break from number work:
- **Evolution overhaul**: cosmetic only (the user's call, no stat or deck changes): the games'
  evolve animation (flashing silhouette switching between the two forms) plus the evolution
  song, which the user supplies as an MP3.
- **The last 4 event scenes**: Move Tutor, Move Deleter, Day Care, Fan Club.
- Missing sound files `hit-super` / `hit-weak` (they fall back to `hit`; the user supplies MP3s).
- Mewtwo's Psychic deck (much later).

### Rules for steps 3–4

- **Rough numbers only, don't fine-tune.** Give each new Pokémon sensible HP and moves in line
  with the ones already in its biome; all real tuning is step 5. Tuning each batch separately
  just gets redone when the next one lands.
- Enemy moves whose real type isn't Fire/Grass/Water get `type: 'normal'` (see CLAUDE.md, Types).
- Every "Normal" slot is a **pure Normal-type** Pokémon, so none has a hidden extra weakness
  (the user's call: Geodude "should" be weak to Water and Grass, so it was swapped out rather
  than adding a fuller type chart). Fire/Grass/Water picks also avoid second types that would
  change their match-ups (no Rock/Ground Fire Pokémon, for example).
- Elites and bosses are neutral, so their types are theme only.
- Each Pokémon appears in exactly one biome (no more Growlithe / Gloom / Arcanine repeats).
- A new Pokémon needs: its Gen 5 animated sprite in `assets/pokemon/<id>-front.gif` (PokeAPI
  sprites, `sprites/pokemon/versions/generation-v/black-white/animated/<dex no>.gif`), its cry
  in `assets/audio/cries/` + `CRIES` in `js/audio.js` (play.pokemonshowdown.com/audio/cries/),
  a `js/data/sprite-fit.js` entry (median bounds over every frame), and its `ENEMY_DEFS` entry.
- Removing a Pokémon: also update Team Rocket's `team` lists in `js/data/events.js`; keep
  Rocket's optional fight no harder than an elite.
- A saved run holds map nodes with `enemyId`s: bump `RUN_SAVE_VERSION` (js/run.js) when
  enemy ids are removed, or old saves will point at missing Pokémon.

## The Pokémon list: 18 per biome, 54 in all

Each biome: 12 wild (3 Fire, 3 Grass, 3 Water, 3 pure Normal, so every starter meets the same
number of good and bad match-ups), 3 elites, 3 bosses. All Gen 1–5, to match the sprite style;
none are starter lines or Pokémon the game uses elsewhere (Moltres, Suicune, Virizion, Mewtwo,
Chansey, Kecleon).

| | Biome 1: Whispering Clearing | Biome 2: Overgrown Shrine | Biome 3: Ember Wastes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Theme | meadow and pond, baby forms | spirits and folklore | volcano, fully evolved |
| Fire | Vulpix, Growlithe, Pansear | Litwick, Houndour, Darumaka | Magmar, Torkoal, Heatmor |
| Grass | Oddish, Hoppip, Seedot | Bellsprout, Paras, Cherubi | Tangela, Cacturne, Maractus |
| Water | Poliwag, Psyduck, Marill | Krabby, Slowpoke, Shellos | Staryu, Crawdaunt, Sharpedo |
| Normal | Rattata, Sentret, Zigzagoon | Teddiursa, Aipom, Stantler | Tauros, Bouffalant, Zangoose |
| Elites | Gloom, Poliwhirl, Flareon | Ninetales, Shiftry, Slowking | Houndoom, Breloom, Kingdra |
| Bosses | Snorlax, Arcanine, Poliwrath | Chandelure, Tangrowth, Ursaring | Slaking, Magmortar, Gyarados |

Leaving the game: Pidgey, Zubat, Machop, Geodude, Rhyhorn, Salamence (the current final boss;
it could stay as a 4th biome-3 boss, since bosses are neutral), plus current bosses Magmar
(becomes a biome-3 wild) and Lapras.

Some lines carry across biomes, for a sense of progression in the Pokédex: Houndour → Houndoom,
Litwick → Chandelure, Teddiursa → Ursaring, Magmar → Magmortar.

Possible later expansion to ~70 (per biome: 3 wild, 1 elite, 1 boss):
- Biome 1: Ponyta, Sunkern, Goldeen; Pidgeotto (elite); Vileplume (boss)
- Biome 2: Darumaka, Petilil, Buizel; Xatu (elite); Lapras (boss)
- Biome 3: Torkoal, Victreebel, Whiscash; Aerodactyl (elite); Cradily (boss)
(Some of these were since used in the main list or aren't pure Normal; re-check before using.)

## Pokédex (step 6)

- Fight rooms on the map show a silhouette until you've beaten that Pokémon; after that, its
  sprite and weakness.
- A Pokédex window, probably in the Poké Ball menu.
- Finishing a biome's set gives an achievement, PokéCoins and maybe a perk.
- Unregistered Pokémon show up a bit more often, so the last few entries don't drag.

## Catching (optional, after the Pokédex)

- Poké Balls sold at the Mart, taking item slots. Throwing one at low HP ends the fight early;
  a miss ends your turn. Changes balance, so it needs another bot run.

## Bot harness in a cloud session

The harness is in the user's private repo `patreekare/pokeDB-sim` (add it with add_repo, clone it
next to this repo). It runs in a browser: serve this repo on port 8130 with the harness's `sim/`
folder symlinked in (`ln -s <sim clone>/sim sim`, then `python3 -m http.server 8130`; add `sim` to
`.git/info/exclude`), and drive `sim/index.html` headless with Playwright (Chromium is at
`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`). `sim/run-headless.mjs` in that repo does this.
